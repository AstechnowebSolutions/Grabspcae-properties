                                        </h3>
                                        <p class="mb-10">
                                              In this digital era where technology is advancing at such a high rate that it is even difficult for 
                                              the humans to cope up with this speed and work, Coworking spaces or Alternative office spaces are 
                                              playing a vital role in the lives of those who are connected to this digitization or corporate sector.
                                              The speed is so fast that if you really want to make that change for which you started your business,
                                              startup or work, you cannot afford to shift your focus at anywhere else other than your work. The
                                              competitiveness of the work culture is increasing day by day and it is very important to grow your

                                              facility where you can only focus on growing yourself and rest everything is assured. Itâ€™s not only
                                              about the facility but the environment that you are working in has a major impact on your work
                                              performance. Coworking Spaces or alternative office spaces gives you an ideal working environment
                                              where you will experience a sudden boost in your work performance.

                                              The concept of co-working spaces started about a century ago and it has now become a widespread 
                                              concept used by individuals and businesses. There is a reason to which why coworking spaces are
                                              widely used. With the digitization increasing and technology evolving day by day in this digital
                                              era, the traditional office approach, where businesses used to start with their own office, can 
                                              actually become a hindrance in your work. In the starting phase of your business or your startup 
                                              you cannot afford to have unnecessary hindrances in your way. With the traditional office 
                                              approach, you have to take care of your office and look after the day-to-day activities going on 
                                              like electricity bill, amenities management, internet issue, and what not, your focus will 
                                              definitely get shifted. Alternative office spaces take care of all that worry for you. If you 
                                              really want to grow up in your business you really need to escape the traditional office 
                                              approach. In this growing non-conventional world where non-orthodox approaches are becoming 
                                              useful and conventional approaches are not giving the desired results, the traditional office 
                                              approach is no longer going to help your business grow.

                                            <br>
                                             We all have seen very harsh times in the covid outbreak straight for more than 3 years. We all 
                                             were caged inside of our homes and had to do everything from our home. Companies did shut, 
                                             employees were laid off and a brutal lapse of time for all of us. We all have seen a time where 
                                             there was recession and the economy of entire world was degrading so somehow, we had to find ways 
                                             for starting the work. We all were forced to work from home and put in our work but that thing has 
                                             actually put us in such a comfort zone where weâ€™ve become very inactive. A work from home mode was 
                                             actually a kind of survival mode where somehow, we had to work so that the business gets going. 
                                             But that is not an all-time thing. However, COVID has taught us that traditional office approach 
                                             is not a thing to continue with because it comes with a lot of expenses that one can actually bear 
                                             and as a result it creates a hindrance in your growth. Especially, when you are a startup or a 
                                             self-employed individual you really need to focus completely on your business. In this type of 
                                             situations, Collaborative workspaces or shared office spaces helps you a great deal. If you are a 
                                             startup and your employees in a work from home mode you can actually rent some coworking spaces, 
                                             these will actually work as alternative office spaces for your employees and as a result your 
                                             employees get that complete office experience and deliver the work that you actually desire.

                                                In contrast to typical offices and WFH, where you are enclosed in a box, coworking spaces are 
                                                based on the collaborative working ethos.It seems sense that debating new ideas, coming up with 
                                                solutions, locating a possible employee or employee, and establishing new employment chances would 
                                                be quick and easy when goal-oriented individuals from many industries work together under one roof.
